      At Politech I was part of the founding team where we set out to build a
      modern marketing suite utilizing the latest breakthroughs in AI. My part
      initially was as an engineer throwing together a proof of concept. Then I
      brought on an engineer to boost the daily productivity and overtime this
      became a team of 8 including a data scientist and domain expert.
